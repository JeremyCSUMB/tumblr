# Tumblr-Feed

**Tumblr** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

üìù `NOTE - PASTE PART 2 SNIPPET HERE:` Paste the README template for part 2 of this assignment here at the top. This will show a history of your development process, which users stories you completed and how your app looked and functioned at each step.


##Tumblr Part 1

## User Stories


The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
-[] Pull to refresh implemented
-[]Activity indicator implemented while images are being retrieved

I'd like to discuss how to further implement animations on the way the app scrolls down. I'd also like to talk about how to cells that are dynamic to the image size.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I had some difficulty understanding how to implement the custom cell, but I was able to figure it out after looking at my flixster.
